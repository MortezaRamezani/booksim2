BookSim is a cycle-accurate interconnection network simulator.
Originally developed for and introduced with the [Principles and Practices of Interconnection Networks]
(http://cva.stanford.edu/books/ppin/) book, its functionality has since been continuously extended.
The current major release, BookSim 2.0, supports a wide range of topologies such as mesh, torus and flattened butterfly networks,
 provides diverse routing algorithms and includes numerous options for customizing the network's router microarchitecture.
